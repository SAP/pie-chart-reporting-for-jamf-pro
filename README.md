## About this project

The Pie Chart Reporting Tool for Jamf Pro is a user-friendly app for viewing reports about internal Macs. These reports are obtained by connecting to a Jamf Pro endpoint management system and displaying specified data gathered from that system in an easy-to-understand pie chart format. The app has a main-view and detail-view architecture, where the main view shows a selectable list of available reports, and the detail-view displays the report's data in a pie chart. The legend for the chart includes the group name, the number of clients, and the percentage of clients in that specific group.

## Demo
See how quickly you can get a visual overview of your managed Macs'.
